"""Auto-import shim that installs the host-side evidence probe.

CPython imports a module named ``sitecustomize`` during start-up if one is
importable, which is how the probe gets into a benchmark process launched by an
arbitrary framework's own entrypoint (``torchrun``, a shell wrapper, whatever)
without editing that entrypoint. The orchestrator prepends this directory to
``PYTHONPATH``; nothing else is required of the target framework.

Two properties matter here:

* **Chaining.** Prepending this directory shadows any ``sitecustomize`` the
  image already ships, which could silently drop that environment's own
  start-up configuration. So this module finds the next ``sitecustomize`` on the
  path *after* our directory and executes it first, before installing the probe.
  It is loaded under a private name (``_hl_prior_sitecustomize``) rather than as
  ``sitecustomize``, since that entry in ``sys.modules`` is already this module.
  Executing it is what preserves its side effects, which is the whole point; a
  prior hook that expects to be importable again *by name* would not find
  itself, but a start-up hook that does that is not a shape we support.
* **Inertness.** The probe installs only when ``HYPERLOOM_HOST_PROBE`` is
  truthy. A benchmark that merely has this directory on ``PYTHONPATH`` behaves
  exactly as if it did not, which is what makes it safe to leave the prefix in
  place across an entire session.

Every failure path is swallowed: a start-up shim must never be the reason a
benchmark process fails to boot.
